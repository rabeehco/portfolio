I am a passionate and results-driven full-stack developer with experience in building quality, high-performance web applications. Over the years, I have honed my expertise in JavaScript, React.js, Next.js, Express.js, and cloud services like AWS, specializing in developing intuitive and efficient digital solutions.

At SnapshareAI, I focus on optimizing frontend performance and user experience, ensuring seamless interactions across devices. By implementing lazy loading, refining state management with Redux, and building reusable components, I contribute to a more efficient and scalable platform.

Previously, at Kodlar Innovations, I led backend architecture design for an account management system and developed a full-stack Tuition Management Application. My role involved streamlining workflows, enhancing security, and improving sprint strategies to accelerate development without compromising quality.

During my tenure at Bridgeon Solutions, I played a key role in developing a Learning Management System (LMS) and an Association Management System (AMS). By leveraging modern frameworks and cloud services, I enhanced system performance, user engagement, and data security. Working within Agile teams, I contributed to structured sprint planning, code reviews, and process optimizations, ensuring smooth project execution.

With a strong foundation in full-stack development and a commitment to continuous learning, I am always eager to tackle new challenges and build impactful digital solutions.
