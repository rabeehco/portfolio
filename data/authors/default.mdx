Hey, Iâ€™m Rabeeh Ebrahim, a passionate frontend developer with three years of experience in full-stack development. 
I specialize in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and love building intuitive, high-performance web applications. 
My journey in software development has led me to focus on JavaScript, React, and Next.js, crafting seamless user experiences.
